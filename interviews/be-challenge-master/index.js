/**
 * Challenge Number 1!
 *
 * getSyncLogSource returns an object with a one method: pop() which will return a LogEntry.
 *
 * A LogEntry is simply an object of the form:
 * {
 * 		date: Date,
 * 		msg: String,
 * }
 *
 * All LogEntries from a given log source are guaranteed to be popped in chronological order.
 * Eventually a log source will end and return boolean false.
 *
 * Your job is simple: print the sorted merge of all LogEntries across `n` log sources.
 *
 * Call `printer.print(logEntry)` to print each entry of the merged output as they are ready.
 * This function will ensure that what you print is in fact in chronological order.
 * Call 'printer.done()' at the end to get a few stats on your solution!
